# chopsticks
Simple chopsticks game in Python 
How it basically works is each player starts with 1 stick on each hand.
The objective is to eliminate the opponent's chopsticks while keeping their own in play.
Players take turns performing actions like "splitting" (clapping hands together and redistributing the total chopsticks as they choose, each hand cannot exceed 4 and go below 1).
Players can also perform actions such as "attacking" (tapping one of the opponent's chopsticks to increase its value by combining it with the tapping hand's value). 
A player is eliminated from the game once they reach a certain point threshold at 5 chopsticks on both hands.
